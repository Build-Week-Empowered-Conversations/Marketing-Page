Proposal

What problem does your app solve?
Empowered Conversation aims to re-envision the future of social support. With our text-based tool, the person you want to have a “hard conversation” with will be texted before the conversation with a heads-up so they can emotionally prepare themselves. From sexual assault disclosure to coming out, transitioning, grief and loss, we set the stage for relationships that are radically more supportive and meaningful than you ever imagined they could be.
Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

Prepares the recipient for an incoming weighty conversation
Helps the sender get emotionally and mentally prepared for the conversation
Helps to set the tone to a more soft, welcoming vibe!

What is the mission statement?
Empowered Conversation aims to re-envision the future of social support.

Research

Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
